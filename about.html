                                    I hail from Anambra in Nigeria, I have African as my home. 
                                    I am the last of four children of my parents. 
                                    As I grew up, I was led by passion for learning. 
                                    I tried to be open to everything new. 
                                    I'm currently pursuing my education. 
                                    Just as a normal person, my life has been filled with obstacles
                                    and triumphs. Pursuing my goals may not be that easy,
                                    but it's interesting facing it. my life has been 
                                    shaped by these ups and downs. 
                                    However, I'm just bent on improving myself ðŸ¤©

                                    That's just what I love to do, learning. 
                                    I schooled at one of the best primary schools 
                                    in our vicinity, if not the best. My secondary 
                                    education was much more like the primary. I'm currently 
                                    an affiliate student of university of Ibadan and an affiliate 
                                    student of the pontificate university Rome

                                My tech journey can be traced to my childhood experiences. 
                                Although I didn't have a great opportunity to experience tech, 
                                I however made use of what I had. The spark started from gaming and handling
                                other digital devices. 
                                I still remembered the hot slap my dad gave me for attempting 
                                to play games with his phone while he was asleep ðŸ˜‚. 
                                However, in the current times, I got really interested 
                                in web design, through movivations of some friends,
                                who I will be glad that they will get to see this one day.  
                                I have learned HTML and CSS to a reasonable extent. 
                                I'm currently finding my way through JavaScript and other languages

                                    My music life has not been the best. In fact, 
                                    I wasn't even interested in music until after my secondary school days.
                                     There was a real pressure for those interested in it. 
                                     I wasn't ready for that kind of stress. However, 
                                     I later gained some interest in music. I listen to cool solemn music. 
                                    Oh..., and I can also play some really great chords on the guitar ðŸŽ¸

                                    Iam a multifaceted soul who finds joy in various pursuits.
                                     Gaming transports me to fantastical realms, 
                                     where I battle with efootball and others. 
                                     Otherwise, I lose myself in the rhythm of music, 
                                     Billie Eilish is my best in this aspect. 
                                     Books also are my trusted companions; especially cool books with 
                                     interesting story lines. The alchemist is one of a kind. 
                                    I also love relishing the magic of movies.
